# Binary Search Tree (BST)

## Key points
1. BST is similar to sorted arrays -> ideas similar to use binary search in sorted arrays!!
2. *BST idiom*: store the best candidate for the result and update candidate as we iteratively descend the tree!
3. *BST property*: L < M < R  
4. operations: min max, lookfor successor/predecessor, enumerate, add/delete key, find -> (most takes O(logn)t); loopup, deletion, insertion -> O(n)t worst case
5. "height-balanced" -> h = O(logn), RBT is height-balanced BST


## JAVA
1. TreeSet
2. TreeMap
* operations: iterator, descendingIterator, last/first/lower/higher/floor/ceiling, headSet/tailSet/subSet ( O(n)t )
